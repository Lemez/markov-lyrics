Can anybody hear me 
I'm on the phone for she on it 
Care bear bumping in the sea 
Why don't you think you're in it 

We know that I never know 
It's a struggle to find true love 
Gonna be okay tomorrow 
I'll try to tell you in love? 

Racism is a boyfriend
Boyfriend, Boyfriend
Tears streamed down both of us cry?
Palms rise to the
Boyfriend

Keep her coming every night 
Once you asked me what I do 
And my best to feed her appetite 
Something I wasn't loving you 

You were through we were getting high? 

Racism is a boyfriend
Boyfriend, Boyfriend
Tears streamed down both of us cry?
Palms rise to the
Boyfriend
